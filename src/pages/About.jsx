            <p>I design high-end custom mechanical keyboards</p>
            <p>
              Currently I am transitioning to a career in web development and as
              you can see, CSS is the bane of my existence. Good thing I'm still
              really good at designing keyboards! :p

              ... I was in the U.S. Army. I held a few positions like sniper
              team leader, fire-team leader and got to train new solders in
              arctic survival. I was also part of a special recon team that
              everyone was jealous of because we didn't have to shave or wear
              nametags. Although it was fun, I prefer programming and keyboards;
              it's easier on my knees
